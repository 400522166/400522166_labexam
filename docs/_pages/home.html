      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p><strong>Lone Wolf Theme</strong> is infamous for abstracting away the UI code and help us focus only on the
        <span class="badge badge-primary">content</span> and the <span class="badge badge-primary">functionalities</span>.</p>
      <p>As an embedded systems software developer I often struggle with the UI for my personal website which hosts my
        work portfolio.</p>
      <p>Have used a freely available website theme for jekyll, like
        <a href="https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/">minimal mistakes</a>.
        But it didn't meet all my expectations besides I wanted to make minimal changes to the UI and make major changes
        to the functionalities like:
        </p><ul class="list-group d-inline-block">
          <li class="list-group-item">
            HTML-2-PDF conversion for blog posts
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            Blog posts reading progress bar.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            Custom Animations.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            Idea submission form
          </li>
        </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p>So I decided to make my own theme which is simple, abstract, elegant and efficient.</p>
      <p class="bg-secondary text-white p-3 rounded">It is aimed at the solo freelancers who host their <span class="badge badge-info">portfolios</span>,
        take <span class="badge badge-info">ideas</span> form submission,
        have a <span class="badge badge-info">todo</span> lists to achieve their goals and
        host a <span class="badge badge-info">blog</span> to pen their thoughts.
      </p>
