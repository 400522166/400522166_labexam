      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p><strong>Lone Wolf Theme</strong> is infamous for abstracting away the UI code and help us focus only on the
        <span class="badge badge-primary">content</span> and the <span
          class="badge badge-primary">functionalities</span>.</p>
      <p>As an embedded systems software developer I often struggle with the UI for my personal website which hosts my
        work portfolio.</p>
      <p>Have used a freely available website theme for jekyll, like
        <a href="https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/">minimal mistakes</a>.
        But since it is a generic theme it didn't meet my specific needs. It is too difficult to make changes to their
        code base.
        Hence I made a simple theme which requires minimal changes to the UI while focusing heavily on the
        functionalities like:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-group d-inline-block mb-3">
        <li class="list-group-item">
          Formalize and record the client communications.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          Self owned web portal to handle the freelance business.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          Simple blog layout.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          Idea submission form, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="bg-secondary text-white p-3 mb-4 rounded">It is aimed at the solo freelancers who host their <span
          class="badge badge-info">portfolios</span>,
        take <span class="badge badge-info">ideas</span> form submission,
        have a <span class="badge badge-info">todo</span> lists to achieve their goals and
        host a <span class="badge badge-info">blog</span> to pen their thoughts.
      </p>
      <h2>Installation</h2>
      <h3>Using remote theme</h3>
      <p>Easiest way to use the theme if you dont want to make changes to the theme's code</p>
      <p>Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">remote_theme             : "manid2/lone-wolf-theme"</code> to your 
        <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file.</p>
      <h3>By forking the theme repository</h3>
      <p>If you want to make changes to the code and to truly own the site.
        Follow the blog on smashing magazine to learn about this method
        <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/">here</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>As a ruby gem</h3>
      <p>When you want to host the site on any server other than the github pages and also to make use of plenty of
        jekyll plugins.</p>
      <p>Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">gem "lone-wolf-theme"</code> to your <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gemfile</code>.</p>
      <p>Update bundled gems by using <code class="highlighter-rouge">bundle</code> command</p>
      <p>Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">theme                    : "lone-wolf-theme"</code> to your 
        <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code>.</p>
