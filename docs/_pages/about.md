*A short story behind making of this theme.*

This is lone-wolf-theme for Jekyll websites. Developed as an exercise for my web development skills.
As a part time solo freelancer I faced bad experiences in dealing with the clients.
Due to no established processes and formal communications people did not take me seriously.
Also ended up working without pay for some time.

So I felt the need to formalize the communication process with the clients.
Inspired by websites like [upwork](https://www.upwork.com/), [bonsai](https://www.hellobonsai.com/), I decided
 to make my own theme with all the necessary [features]({{ '/features/' | absolute_url }}) for a freelancer.

By making use of the source code from two well known free and open source jekyll themes
 [minimal mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) and [cards](https://webjeda.com/cards/)
 I made a simple version of this theme. It is highly oriented towards the solo freelancers who either starting out
 or well established.
