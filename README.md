### Using remote theme

### By forking the theme repository

If you want to make changes to the code and to truly own the site. Follow the blog on smashing magazine to learn about this method [here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/).

### As a ruby gem

When you want to host the site on any server other than the github pages and also to make use of plenty of jekyll plugins.
Add `gem "lone-wolf-theme"` to your `Gemfile`.
Update bundled gems by using `bundle` command.
Add `theme                    : "lone-wolf-theme"` to your `_config.yml`.
